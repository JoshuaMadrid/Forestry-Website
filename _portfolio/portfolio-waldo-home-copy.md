  project_title: WALDO HOME
  project_description: When the we first walked into this house a few things struck
    us. First, were the large windows and ample natural light. Second, were the high
    ceilings. Third, was the third floor, a finished space with beautiful pine floors.
    It hadn't been updated in 40 years and didn't have air conditioning, but we were
    convinced that with a lot of love, and a lot of retro fitting, we could make this
    an ideal family home. There were a few key factors in making that happen. We rearranged
    the kitchen and blew out the dining room wall to create connectivity on the 1st
    floor. We rearranged the walls on the 2nd floor to insert a second full bath and
    create and en suite master bathroom. We delicately inserted a new HVAC system
    in without losing any habitable space in the house. Now this home has all the
    charm of a 100 year old house with all of the amenities that a 21st century family
    requires.
