    If you are walking down this Brookside street, you probably won’t notice the garage at the bottom of the driveway. It blends seamlessly into the traditional neighborhood. You’d never guess at what you’ll find at the end of the driveway. But as you come into the backyard, you’ll find a pool, fire pit, expansive deck, hot tub. We collaborated closely with the owners to fully maximize their modest backyard to create an oasis of fun for their family and friends.

    As you proceed, you’ll see the garage turn into a lofty modern pool house. The entire east facade of the pool house has windows from floor to roof, including a glass garage door at the indoor / outdoor bar. The interior has a double height lounge area and a sunny loft above the garage space. We took advantage of every square inch of the structure, locating storage and lounge spaces in every eave. The deck waterfalls down from the house, to the hot tub, and down to the pool. The absence of railings allows an unimpeded view of the pool and pool house.
