  project_title: MASTER OF ALL BATHS
  project_description: The original master bathroom in this suburban home suffered
    from a rampant trend from the 90â€™s, the gigantic spa tub. So while there was plenty
    of light and space, there was also a tiny shower and vanity. We revamped the space
    by partitioning the room into two sides to create a shower sanctuary and a toilette
    area. The toilette area is warm and bright with ample storage for toiletries,
    linens and laundry. One can walk right into the zero entry shower and have a quiet
    calm experience with sunlight streaming in from the skylight.
