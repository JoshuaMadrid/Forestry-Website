  project_title: MATERIAL & MINUTIA
  project_description: Small projects can be the incredibly complex. In this Rockridge,
    CA home we designed two bathrooms where one used to be and renovated the fireplace.
    The keys to success here were high quality materials and extreme attention to
    detail. We were inspired by the clients' love for the arts and crafts style of
    their home as well as hand glazed tile.
