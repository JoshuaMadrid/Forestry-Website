  project_description: |-
    The challenge in this house was to create usable, enjoyable, character-rich rooms out of leftover, unfinished spaces.

    <br><br>

    It started in the bottom with a classic Brookside tuck-under garage. Thick foundation walls, generous head height to structure, and existing plumbing runs all made for a space with a lot of potential. By taking advantage of the limited existing windows and dramatic natural light, the design creates a sophisticated and swanky lounge-like living room complete with a full wet bar, powder room, and card table/game area. The result is a elegant hang out space with the feel of an exclusive speak-easy.

    <br><br>

    Adjacent to the lounge is a mud room, dog wash, and catch-all drop zone for belongings. Custom walnut cubbies provide ample storage for bookbags and school gear while a hidden space under the stair is outfitted with a cozy and comfortable kennel for the familyâ€™s two little doggies. The kennel is softly lit from inside with a concealed light switch in the framing.

    <br><br>

    At the very opposite end of the house, existing attic space was reconceived as a suite of rooms for the children as they grow. By adding a couple modest, well-placed dormers to the roofline and taking advantage of every possible inch of head height, the third floor became a playful children-only area. Beneath the sloping ceilings of the dormers are two extra bedrooms, a full bathroom between them, and a quirky, playful reading nook at the top of the stairs.

    <br><br>

    If the basement is about sophistication and style, these spaces are all about the light!
