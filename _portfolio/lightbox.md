  project_title: LIGHT BOX
  project_description: When we came to this row house, the entire front of the structure
    was essentially falling off. We viewed that as a great opportunity to rebuild
    the face of the house with large windows, and reclaimed brick to make a modern
    facade that fits within the context of the South Philly neighborhood. The row
    house is a narrow rectangular box that can only have windows on the short ends
    so maximizing the light and creating a clever plan were key to making this house
    sunny and warm. The entire first floor is open from living room, to kitchen including
    the stairs to create a spacious feeling living space in this compact home. We
    changed the layout of the second floor to locate the bedrooms on either end with
    large windows and put with the closet and bathroom in the center of the house.
    Even the tiny backyard is a pleasant space to inhabit with cedar decking, a custom
    bench and planter, and privacy screen.
