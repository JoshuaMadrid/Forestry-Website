    let's get to know each other We begin every project by listening. We want to hear what your goals are; what you hope to achieve in doing this project and what you expect to gain when it's complete.

    To facilitate this conversation, we have developed an Initial Client Survey. This high-level set of questions gets you to state in your own words your Desired Outcomes, Project Priorities, Key Components, Design Aesthetic (if any), and any known Design Constraints. It helps clients to sharpen their objectives and it guides us during design. If after this phase, we are a good fit for your project, then we are ready to dig in.

                We work intentionally with our clients
                -arriving at
                something desired, but also unexpected
                -and the
                process relies on a lot on back-and-forth dialog and
                discovery. While each project is unique, most of our
                work tends to follow the same four general phases:
                Consultation, Design, Documentation, & Construction.

                    <p><b>a discovery-based process</b><br>
                    This is the core of what we do: we imagine the possibilities, test the limits of constraint, and shape potential solutions. This phase has three distinct stages that result in a clear design direction that can be initially priced by a general contractor:
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="SeeMore">
                    <b>Measure and Model Existing Conditions</b>
                    Before we do anything, it is critical to understand exactly what exists on the site today…even if nothing exists on the site today. We do this by taking in-person field measurements, photographs and (usually) obtaining a certified survey of the property. This information is then compiled with any existing owner-supplied drawing content as well as publicly available information (such as zoning or utility data) to create an accurate site plan of the property and 3D model of the project area. 
                    <br><br>
                    It is impossible to propose changes without knowing what it is we are changing 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Schematic Design (SD)</b>
                    It’s time to put pen to paper and start designing! In this stage, we apply the established scope and program to spatial design concepts. We always provide at least two different design options that satisfy the project goals, but often it is three, four, or even five. Each concept will have different merits which the client can evaluate and consider against their objectives. Then, working with you and your feedback, we rework the best qualities from each and develop them into another round of design options, striving to reduce the number down to one. And that is the back-and-forth! 
                    <br><br>
                    This process is repeated until one, clear design direction emerges. It is at that point that we can move on to the next stage of development.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Design Development (DD)</b>
                    Now is when things get real. With the “what ifs” of the previous stage out of the way, we can grab hold of the preferred design and really refine it. This stage gets into the details in a way that is aimed at eliminating the possibility of major modifications or backtracking during the Documentation Phase. The goal here is to define and describe the project as much as possible so that in the next phase, documenting it can be the focus. It is also at this point that we typically pause to analyze probably costs of the project, construction schedule, and other build-out considerations in conjunction with the selected general contractor. If major changes need to be made as a result of anticipated costs or schedule, we address them now.
                    <br><br>
                    Design Development concludes the WHAT is to be built phase of the project and jump-starts the HOW it is to be built phase.

            <b>memorializing critical information</b><br>
            The Construction Document stage shifts the effort from WHAT is being designed to documenting HOW the project will be implemented. Additional design issues may still emerge as the design team works out the final material and system selections; however, these issues are often minor and should not affect major architectural elements.</p>
            <p><span class="SeeMore">
             The construction documents include three basic types of information: 1.) legal and contractual information, 2.) procedural and administrative information, and 3.) architectural and construction information. The latter are used to secure a construction permit from the governing authority at this time.
            <br><br>
            Clear, coordinated construction Documents communicate, in detail, to the owner what the project involves through drawings, specifications, bidding requirements, contract forms and supplementary conditions. This ensures a smooth construction process with as few unexpected complications as possible.

            <b>preserving the design intent</b><br>
            To the extent possible (or desired by the client) we remain involved in the project throughout construction. We observe the construction progress at regular intervals, photographing it for our records and troubleshooting real world issues as they arise. As the architects, we are the ultimate voice in interpretting the Construction Documents.</p>
            <p><span class="SeeMore">
             If, for any reason, something is not clear or there is a discrepancy in the project, it is our job to weigh in and preserve the design intent as the project gets built.
            <br><br>
            The construction phase brings all the concept design, detailed design, construction documents, and intent into realization.
