    We work thoughtfully to create beautiful spaces. We respect our clients and feel
    strongly that architecture should be approachable to anyone, on any budget. \n\nWe

    bio: "<p><strong>Brian Michener</strong> is a licensed architect and urban designer
      with extensive experience in both fields of work. His principal interest is
      in the interrelation of architecture and urban design, shaping the built environment
      through the creation of vibrant and engaging places that are both environmentally
      sustainable and intensely site-specific. Brian will research a subject until
      he knows everything there is to know about it; however, he will also impulsively
      jump into something with a seriously healthy dose of naive confidence.</p><p>Education:</p><p>Williams
